# Loader

## Purpose

The purpose of the loader is to be exposed to the end developer, they should be
able to use its functions to get the remote packages properly. The loader should
not care whether it is frontend or backend, just needs to know how to load in
the content, it will be directed by the plugins as some Apps will require a
different way to be served the information and files.
