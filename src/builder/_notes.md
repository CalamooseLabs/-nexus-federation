# Builder

## Purpose

The purpose of the builder is to create a generic builder using currently Deno
Emit package, but it should be able to be interchanged with most other builders
as long as the plugin allows to speak a similar nature. The builder will be
directed by the composer options as this will give it insight in how the build
show be completed.
