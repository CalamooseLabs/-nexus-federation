**Internal App** is a module federation plugin for Deno, inspired by the concept
of module federation, micro frontends, and microservices. This middleware allows
seamless sharing of components between independent applications by setting up a
federated gateway. As well as providing a federated gateway for backend
services.

---

## Features

- **Easy Federation**: Share components across apps with minimal setup.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Components are loaded on-demand in the consumer app,
  reducing bundle size.
- **Alias Mapping**: Use simple aliases to reference remote components,
  abstracting away the URL routing.

## Getting Started

### Producer/Gateway Setup

To create a producer app or gateway, you need to set up the configuration for
the remote components.

1. **Step One**
   ```typescript
   console.log("Step One");
   ```

2. **Step Two**
   ```typescript
   console.log("Step Two");
   ```

### Consumer Setup

To consume the producer app, you need to set up the alias configuration for the
remote components.

1. **Step One**
   ```typescript
   console.log("Step One");
   ```

2. **Step Two**
   ```typescript
   console.log("Step Two");
   ```
